# Weary

_The Weary need REST_

Weary is a tiny DSL for making the consumption of RESTful web services simple. It is the little brother to [HTTParty](http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/ "JNunemaker's HTTParty"). It provides a thin, gossamer-like layer over the Net/HTTP library.

The things it do:

+ Quickly build an interface to your favorite REST API.
+ Parse XML and JSON with the [Crack](http://github.com/jnunemaker/crack) library.

## Requirements
